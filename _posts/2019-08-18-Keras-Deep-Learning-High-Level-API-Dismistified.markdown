# [Keras][kerasurl]: Hacking the Most Popular High Level Deep Learning API (PART I)

Although [Google's TensorFlow][tensorflowurl] is recognized between [one of many][dllibs], it's python High Level API Keras still the most popular python module to products and research in Deep Neural Networks. It emboddies simplicity in the use and allows the user fast access to the elements AI/Deep Neural Networks Research, paving the way to the popularization of Neural Network modelling.

This post is an intended guide to hack/uncover python APIs designed for high level scientific computation built up on diverse computing paradigm, in this case the Computational Graph language paradigm.
