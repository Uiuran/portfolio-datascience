<h1 id="rossmann-drug-retailer-6-weeks-sales-prediction">Rossmann drug retailer 6 weeks sales prediction</h1>
<p>Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store
managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are
influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, season-
ality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique
circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.</p>
