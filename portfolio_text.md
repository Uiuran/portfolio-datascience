# Welcome
### Hi, my name is Daniel Penalva, welcome to my Data portfolio. Data Analytics, Data Engineering and Data Science are the new hot jobs for an ever growing demand for work on data for business insights and values. Iam excited to share my skills and also demonstrate them to you, currently i can fill the Data Analytics and Data Science roles, but iam recently adding new Data Engineering skills, so soon i will be having proficiency to exercise this role too.
### Feel free to get in touch if you find interesting.

# Bio

### I have Master degree in Physics with 1 year working on a startup of water leak and waste detection named Stattus4. Currently iam working on my Data Projects, on many different datasets, and doing a Specialization/MBA in Data Engineering and Big Data.
### At Stattus4 i worked with time series analysis, feature extraction using spectral analysis and neural networks development.
### In my actual projects i aim to show how to deliver business value using a cyclic method of development, where each cycle i pass through all the steps of an Data Science project and deliver business value from the first cycle of the project. I develop my projects altogether with a whole private Data Science community in Brazil with more than 900 practitioners.
### Iam searching oportunities to work in Data Science role and Data Engineering role as well.

# Skills
