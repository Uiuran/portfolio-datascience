<h1 id="1-business-problem">1. Business Problem.</h1>
<p>Financial inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, only 9.1 million adults (14% of adults) have access to or use a business bank account.</p>
<p>In 2008, the level of financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa was just over 23%. In 2018, that number almost doubled. In Togo, Mazamesso Assih, finance minister, coordinates a financial inclusion strategy with partner banks. He states that ensuring access to basic financial services for the population is critical to boosting the African economy.</p>
<p>In 2022, as highlighted in the latest report by the Central Bank of West Africa, one of the highest rates of financial inclusion in the region was reached, close to 82%. A significant portion of this increase came from the rise of digital financial services.</p>
<p>Assih also states that there are three main reasons why African nations should focus on financial inclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making financial services more accessible promotes the empowerment of the most vulnerable people, especially women.</li>
<li>Fighting Criminal Networks Moving from an exclusively cash economy to a digital financial infrastructure makes it easier for authorities to track transactions and deal with smugglers and traffickers.</li>
<li>boost public and private sector connectivity for sustainable growth, supporting African start-ups.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Step 01. Data Description:</strong></p>
<p><img src="resources/dataglossary.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Since the dataset was in a legible previous format and had no NA, this steps is subsummed with statistical description of numeric values.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="resources/numericdescription.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>No notable discrepancy was found in the statistical summary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 02. Feature Engineering:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The following hypothesis were uplifted for the problem:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>H1.</strong> Developed countries has 10 % more digital bank accounts</p>
<p><strong>H2.</strong> Urban zone has 50% more digital bank accounts than country-side zone.</p>
<p><strong>H3.</strong> 80% of the people with cellphone and internet has digital bank accounts</p>
<p><strong>H4.</strong> Quantity of people with undergraduated degree that has digital bank account are greater than the other levels of education.</p>
<p><strong>H5.</strong> People between 18 and 40 years old constitute 85% of the basis of digital bank account.</p>
<p><strong>H6.</strong> Women are marjority of the digital bank accounts</p>
<p><strong>H7.</strong> People older than 60 with cellphone doesnt have digital bank account in general.</p>
<p><strong>H8.</strong> 95% of unemployed people doesnt have digital bank account.</p>
<p><strong>H9.</strong> 100% of the head-of-the-house has digital bank account.</p>
<ul>
<li>We created many features, notably country_zone and country_edu by concatenating the respective features.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 03. Data Filtering:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As we have seen previously in the Data Description, filtering step was not necessary for this dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We proceed with the bivariated EDA for hypothesis testing. We list the main notable insights in the session below. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For the multivariated analysis we divided between numerical and categorical data and plot the correlation matrix (Pearson and V-Kramer correlations).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Numeric attributes (year,household_size and age_of_respondent):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="resources/multivariatednumeric.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><p>No significant correlation is noted for these 3 features.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Categorical attributes (country,location_type,cellphone_access,gender_of_respondent,relationship_with_head,marital_status,education_level,job_type,bank_account):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="resources/multivariatedcategorical.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Country has significant correlation with location_type, job_type.</li>
<li>Location_type has correlation with job_type.</li>
<li>Relationship_with_head has correlation with gender_of_respondent.</li>
<li>Correlation was found for education_level and job_type with the target bank_account suggesting that they are sound variables for predicting bank accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 05. Data Preparation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We do LabelEncoder and FrequencyEncoder for the features. </li>
<li>We used MinMaxScaler in the features since some algorithms such Logistic Regression requires that the features stay in the same scale.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 06. Feature Selection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We use the classifier Random Forest to select features by seeing their importance and the standart deviation of the importance.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="resources/featureselection.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>From the features create, the feature country_zone had a great importance for the model.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 07. Machine Learning Modelling:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Four models were tested for classification: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The metric used to quantify the models was F1-Score.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Support Vector Machine was the most time consuming, since it underperformed in relation to the other models we decided to not go further with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next we performed cross-validation on the models, their F1-Score.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#39;Random Forest&#39;: 0.8626057210431016</li>
<li>&#39;Logistic Regression&#39;: 0.6677682543373659</li>
<li>&#39;KNN&#39;: 0.8245776464175861</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tunning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since Random Forest was the best scoring model, we decided to go further with it.</li>
<li>We performed random search of the number of estimators of the forest and the max depth of each tree estimator.</li>
<li>By setting a limit of tries in the random search and setting a grid of 24 pair of parameters, we have selected by looking at cross-validation F1-scorethe model with 3000 estimators and a tree depth of 9 steps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 09. Convert Model Performance to Business Values:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not considered in this challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 10. Deploy Modelo to Production:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There was no such need in this challenge.</li>

<h1 id="4-top-3-data-insights">4. Top 3 Data Insights</h1>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 01: Urban Areas has 50% more digital bank accounts than country-side area</strong></p>
<p><strong>False.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its was seen that, for this dataset, the number of bank accounts in Urban and in country-side areas are nearly equal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 02: People with higher degree of education has the marjority of bank accounts</strong></p>
<p><img src="resources/eduleveleda.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>True</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its interesting to observe that the number of bank accounts by education level follows a ladder from the uneducated to the most educated except for the last two columns that may be an artifact of having more vocational formation as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 03: People between 18 and 40 years old constitute 85% of the digital bank account basis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>False.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was found that people between 18 and 40 years old constitute 61% of the basis.</li>
